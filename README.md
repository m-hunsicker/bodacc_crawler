# bodacc_crawler
Simple Python tool to extract BODACC alerts given a list of SIREN identifiers.
The script currently uses a sqlite database that gets initialised by a CSV file.

It uses the web content and not the pdf files provided by the bodacc. 

Feel free to contac me in case you have any question. 
All the best
